Here is a list of the libraries I used in the development of **Contrátame**:

Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Werkzeug: A comprehensive WSGI web application library.

qrcode: A QR code generation library.

Mostly unused in current version of **Contrátame**:

base64: A module that provides tools for encoding binary data to printable ASCII characters and decoding such encodings back to binary data.

io (BytesIO): Part of Python's core I/O library, BytesIO is used for handling binary data in memory, which is useful when dealing with file-like objects (like images) that you don't want to store on disk.

os: A module in Python's standard library that provides a way to use operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the filesystem.

mimetypes: A module from Python's standard library. It's used to map filenames to MIME types. This could be used in your application to handle file uploads and ensure correct file types.

PIL (Python Imaging Library) / Pillow: Image and ImageOps are part of PIL (or Pillow, a more modern fork of PIL), which is a powerful image processing library in Python.

io (for general I/O operations): This is a part of Python's core I/O library, used for handling various types of I/O operations.
